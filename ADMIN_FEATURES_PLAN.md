## 🎨 UI Design

### Layout
- Use existing sidebar layout
- Add "Admin" section to sidebar (only visible to admins)
- Consistent with existing dark theme + gold accents

### Pages
1. `/admin` - Analytics dashboard
2. `/admin/users` - User management
3. `/admin/vehicles` - Vehicle management

### Components
- Reuse existing UI components (tables, buttons, cards)
- Add search/filter components
- Add confirmation dialogs
- Add stat cards for dashboard

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Middleware**: All admin routes protected
2. **Authorization**: Check `is_admin` on every request
3. **Validation**: Validate all inputs
4. **Confirmation**: Require confirmation for destructive actions
5. **Logging**: Log all admin actions

## 📊 Database Queries Needed

### User Stats
```sql
-- Total users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

-- Recent registrations (7 days)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;

-- Users with most vehicles
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as vehicle_count FROM vehicles GROUP BY user_id ORDER BY vehicle_count DESC;
```

### Vehicle Stats
```sql
-- Total vehicles
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles;

-- Recent saves (7 days)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;

-- Most saved vehicles
SELECT registration, COUNT(*) as save_count FROM vehicles GROUP BY registration ORDER BY save_count DESC LIMIT 10;
```
