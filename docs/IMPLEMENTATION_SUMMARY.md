- Faster response times for cached results
- Lower API costs
- Better user experience

Added rate limiting to prevent API abuse:

#### Configuration
- **10 requests per minute** per IP address
- Applied to `POST /reg-lookup` route
- Uses Laravel's built-in throttle middleware
- Returns HTTP 429 when limit exceeded

#### Implementation
```php
Route::post('reg-lookup', [VehicleLookupController::class, 'lookup'])
    ->middleware('throttle:10,1')
    ->name('reg.lookup.search');
```

**File**: `routes/web.php`

## 🎯 What's Working Now

### New User Flow: Save Vehicles
1. User performs reg lookup (public or logged in)
2. If logged in, sees "Save Vehicle" button
3. Clicks save → vehicle stored in database
4. Can view all saved vehicles on dashboard
5. Can delete vehicles from dashboard
6. If already saved, shows "Already Saved" status

### Performance Improvements
- **First lookup**: Hits DVLA API, caches result
- **Subsequent lookups**: Instant response from cache
- **Cache duration**: 24 hours
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse (10/min)

### Dashboard Features
- Vehicle count display
- Beautiful vehicle cards with all details
- Delete functionality
- Empty state with CTA
- Quick actions and help links
- Responsive design

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

### Vehicle Saving
- [ ] Perform reg lookup while logged out → see register/login prompt
- [ ] Register/login → perform lookup → see "Save Vehicle" button
- [ ] Click "Save Vehicle" → vehicle appears on dashboard
- [ ] Try to save same vehicle again → see "Already Saved" status
- [ ] Go to dashboard → see saved vehicle with all details
- [ ] Delete vehicle → confirm it's removed
- [ ] Save multiple vehicles → all appear on dashboard

### Caching
- [ ] Perform lookup → check logs for "DVLA API Success"
- [ ] Perform same lookup again → check logs for "DVLA Cache Hit"
- [ ] Wait 24 hours → lookup again → should hit API again

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Perform 10 lookups quickly → should work
- [ ] Perform 11th lookup → should get rate limit error (429)
- [ ] Wait 1 minute → should work again

### Hero Videos
- [ ] Visit homepage → videos should cycle smoothly
- [ ] No console errors about missing video files
- [ ] Videos 1, 2, 3 should rotate every 8 seconds

## 📝 Database Changes

### New Table: `vehicles`
```sql
CREATE TABLE vehicles (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    registration VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
    vehicle_data JSON NOT NULL,
    tyre_size VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    notes TEXT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    INDEX (registration)
);
```

**Migration**: Already run ✅

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### Cache Configuration
