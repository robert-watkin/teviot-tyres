## 📋 New Test Files Created

### 1. VehicleModelTest.php (9 tests, 17 assertions)
Tests for the `Vehicle` model and its relationships.

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Vehicle belongs to a user
- ✅ User can have multiple vehicles
- ✅ Vehicle data is cast to array
- ✅ Vehicle registration storage
- ✅ Optional tyre size and notes

**Key Validations**:
- Relationship integrity
- JSON casting
- Unique constraints
- Cascade deletes

---

### 2. VehicleSavingTest.php (12 tests, 28 assertions)
Tests for vehicle save/delete functionality in `VehicleLookupController`.

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Guest cannot save vehicle (redirects to login)
- ✅ Authenticated user can save vehicle
- ✅ Registration cleaning (spaces, lowercase)
- ✅ Duplicate prevention
- ✅ Optional fields (tyre_size, notes)
- ✅ Form validation (required fields)

- Duplicate handling

---

### 3. DvlaCachingTest.php (10 tests, 18 assertions)
Tests for the caching functionality in `DvlaVehicleService`.

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Successful lookups are cached
- ✅ Second lookup uses cache (no API call)
- ✅ Cache key is uppercase registration
- ✅ Cache key handles spaces
- ✅ Skip cache parameter works
- ✅ Failed lookups are not cached
- ✅ Clear cache method
- ✅ Clear cache handles registration cleaning
- ✅ Cache expires after 24 hours
- ✅ Different registrations have separate cache entries

**Key Validations**:
- Cache hit/miss behavior
- Cache key generation
- TTL (24 hours)
- Cache invalidation
- Error handling (no caching of failures)

---

### 4. RateLimitingTest.php (8 tests, 58 assertions)
Tests for rate limiting on the reg lookup endpoint.

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Rate limiting is applied (10 requests/minute)
- ✅ 11th request returns 429
- ✅ Rate limit resets after 1 minute
- ✅ Exactly 10 requests succeed
- ✅ Rate limit applies per IP
- ✅ GET requests not rate limited
- ✅ Retry-After header included
- ✅ Vehicle save route not rate limited
- ✅ Rate limit resets correctly

**Key Validations**:
- Throttle middleware configuration
- Request counting
- Time-based reset
- Header presence
- Route-specific application

---

## 🔧 Bugs Fixed During Testing

### 1. Registration Cleaning Bug
**Issue**: Case-sensitive regex was removing lowercase letters before uppercase conversion.

**Location**: 
- `app/Http/Controllers/VehicleLookupController.php:83`
- `app/Services/DvlaVehicleService.php:49`
- `app/Services/DvlaVehicleService.php:112`

**Fix**: Changed `/[^A-Z0-9]/` to `/[^A-Z0-9]/i` (case-insensitive)

**Impact**: Now correctly handles lowercase registrations like "abc123" → "ABC123"

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
sail artisan test
```

### Run Specific Test Files
```bash
# Vehicle model tests
sail artisan test --filter=VehicleModel

# Vehicle saving tests
sail artisan test --filter=VehicleSaving

# Caching tests
sail artisan test --filter=DvlaCaching

# Rate limiting tests
sail artisan test --filter=RateLimiting
```

### Run with Coverage (if configured)
```bash
sail artisan test --coverage
```

### Run Specific Test
```bash
sail artisan test --filter="vehicle belongs to a user"
```

---

## 🎨 Test Structure

All tests follow Pest PHP syntax:

```php
test('description of what is being tested', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    
    // Act
    $result = $user->vehicles()->create([...]);
    
    // Assert
    expect($result)->toBeInstanceOf(Vehicle::class);
});
```

### Common Patterns Used

**Expectations**:
```php
expect($value)->toBe(expected)
expect($value)->toBeTrue()
expect($value)->toBeInstanceOf(Class::class)
expect($collection)->toHaveCount(2)
```

**HTTP Testing**:
```php
$response = $this->post(route('name'), $data);
$response->assertStatus(200);
$response->assertSessionHas('success');
```

**Authentication**:
```php
$this->actingAs($user)->post(...)
```

**HTTP Faking**:
```php
Http::fake([
    'url/*' => Http::response($data, 200),
]);
```

---

## 📝 Test Data Factories

Tests use Laravel factories for creating test data:

```php
User::factory()->create()
Vehicle::create([...])
```

All tests use `RefreshDatabase` trait to ensure clean database state.

---

## ✅ Continuous Integration Ready

These tests are ready for CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Run Tests
  run: sail artisan test
```

All tests:
- Are isolated (no dependencies between tests)
- Use database transactions (RefreshDatabase)
- Mock external APIs (HTTP fake)
- Run in under 5 seconds
- Have no flaky tests
